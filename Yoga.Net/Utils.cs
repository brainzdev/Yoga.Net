    // - itemsOnLine: Number of items which can fit in a line considering the
    //   available Inner dimension, the flex items computed flexbasis and their
    //   margin. It may be different than the difference between start and end
    //   indicates because we skip over absolute-positioned items.
    //
    // - sizeConsumedOnCurrentLine: It is accumulation of the dimensions and margin
    //   of all the children on the current line. This will be used in order to
    //   either set the dimensions of the node if none already exist or to compute
    //   the remaining space left for the flexible children.
    //
    // - totalFlexGrowFactors: total flex grow factors of flex items which are to be
    //   layed in the current line
    //
    // - totalFlexShrinkFactors: total flex shrink factors of flex items which are
    //   to be layed in the current line
    //
    // - endOfLineIndex: Its the end index of the last flex item which was examined
    //   and it may or may not be part of the current line(as it may be absolutely
    //   positioned or including it may have caused to overshoot availableInnerDim)
    //
    // - relativeChildren: Maintain a vector of the child nodes that can shrink
    //   and/or grow.
